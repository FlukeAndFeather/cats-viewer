```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

3d visualizations of whale feeding behavior collected using CATS tags. 

## Installation

Clone this repo using GitHub tools. The sample data is stored on figshare. If you're in the cats-viewer project, you can download the data by:

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/17625341", "data/bw170813-44/bw170813-44 10Hzprh.csv")
```

## Usage

If you're in RStudio, open server.R or ui.R and use the 'Run App' shortcut button. The sample data is 382 MB, so give it a minute to load. The first plot you'll see is the overall dive profile. Click and drag to select a region to zoom, which will show up in the second plot. Click on a dive to see a 3d rendering with lunges (feeding events) marked in orange. Click on a lunge to see sensor data of the lunge. From top to bottom, these plots are depth, speed, pitch/roll, and the y-axis gyroscope. The last plot is useful for identifying fluke strokes.
